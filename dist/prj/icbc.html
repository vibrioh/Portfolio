      <h2 class="section">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As the world’s largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) naturally requires exceptionally
        efficient, newest and most interesting attempts to use AI and ML in the lending business. IBM provides the AI
        solutions with the contract of $10 Millions. We provide high-performance distributed graph database and graph
        computing solutions to IBM as a subcontractor at $2 Millions. The project is huge, complicated and even
        exploratory. The main aim is risk management on loans. With the numerous data，the system can predict
        non-performing loans and simulate loan default cascades by modifying relations/properties of bank's customers.
        The key features are acquired from graph computing, such as cycles, paths, closeness, betweenness, page rank,
        connected components and so on. There are some features such as hidden relationships prediction and dynamic
        graph display are novel to this industry.

      </p>

      <h2 class="section">Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        My main task is system deployment/integration/automation by Shell/Python scripts, client module in Python and
        Dynamic Graph backend with Java. To deploy, graph database, graph engine, graph REST API, will be wrapped into
        container with Flask/uWSGI/Nginx/Ubuntu using Docker. The images of Grest/Gasync (async server) will be
        deployed with 3-clustered Kafka on 5 openSUSE servers. Upstream ETL processes data from ICBC Data Warehouse
        each day and dumps to Graph Application Layer. The system
        will detect, check and trigger loading process. Loading schema for one day's batch covers 9 main relationships
        (edge label), more
        than 70 true relations (edge properties) and over 600 millions loan customers (vertices). The batch-run
        commands is configured into scripts and executed by High Availability Module, which is monitoring each server's
        health status and switching between main and backup servers. Loading requests/files are processed and pushed to
        Kafka clusters through Async sever, graph servers pull requests and finish loading. Then the predefined
        analytics which are formed from complex business requirements will be invoked. It will compute all the features
        needed for UI and ML module. The results will be stored locally in graph database and ported to Oracle Database
        for downstream queries. All communications are
        through RESTful API and Client Module in the Grest server.

        <p>
          Successfully delivered phase I (Basic Function and Dynamic Graph), II (Async and Distributed) and IV (Hight
          Availability) so far, accumulating data for phase III (ML Module).
