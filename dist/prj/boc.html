      <h2 class="section">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Adaptive Cybersecurity Monitoring System shall gather all relevant and available information about users,
        devices, applications, and network events (collectively referred to as “entities”), detect anomalies at various
        levels, and provide an aggregate risk assessment to predict cybersecurity risks of all entities. Due to the
        inherent complexity associated with the development of the system’s information gathering mechanism (including
        identifying, understanding, and formatting the source information), a phased approach is adopted to
        progressively enable the analysis capabilities and surface analytical results at the user interface for
        follow-up investigation by the monitoring individuals.


      </p>

      <h2 class="section">Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The Adaptive Cybersecurity Monitoring System takes as input various levels of data from multiple monitoring
        tools current in place at BOCNY, and produces as output an interactive visualization interface for the
        monitoring individuals to review analytical results. The system is consisted of three main internal components.
        The data processing component processes the raw data from the original data sources to extract, transform,
        index, and load the needed information into the system’s central data store. It also computes features from the
        processed data, which are used to create behavior models. The analysis component runs multiple anomaly
        detection methods (e.g. behavior-based and flow-based) and generates an overall risk assessment. The
        visualizations component presents analytical results and allows detail drill-down of data, which enables the
        monitoring individuals to more easily consume system output in context through interactive visual analytics.


        <h2 class="section">Highlight</h2>
        <p>
          1) The combination of behavior-based anomaly detection and flow-based anomaly detection to detect anomalies
          from multiple perspectives. <br>
          2) The use of graph and cognitive reasoning technologies to fuse various anomaly detection results and
          propagate risks for producing an aggregate risk assessment.

        </p>
        <h2 class="section">Achievement</h2>
        <p>
          I delivered feature selection and graph database deployment, feature extraction.
