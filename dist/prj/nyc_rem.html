      <h2 class="section">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Property management database is a web-based real estate database that provides information and service for
        homebuyers, home sellers and real estate agents to exchange property information more efficiently among them.
        This database stores information about property details, building neighborhood, school, transportation, lists
        of price, etc. related to property and agents who holds the source of property. A homebuyer could utilize the
        database to look for their likely interesting home by zip code, address, price, property type (condo, house,
        apartment), school district and other specific condition. Real estate agents can widely publicize their
        listings and get contacted by potential homebuyers. Homeowners can hire the good performance agents depending
        on their past trading record.</p>
      <h2 class="section">Implementation</h2>
      <p>A property has a unique property ID, address, a zip code, the number of bedroom and bathroom, the area of
        squire feet and a built date. One property lies in one block. The property has a list of price. The property is
        sold by an agent and belonged one owner. Sale state is the state to describe if the property is on sale right
        now. Sale state still shows what is the start sale date and end sale date. The price is composed of listing
        price, maintenance fee and tax deduction. Each property has an evaluated price and a last time sold price.
        Block is the district where property belongs. Each block has a unique district ID. Some block locates at water
        front division. The block has its commute system such as bus and subway. School district has its unique
        district number. The public school including primary, middle and high school have scores rated by education
        system. Sell agent has a unique register ID, first name, last name and telephone. Owner has a unique SSN
        number, first name and last name.</p>
