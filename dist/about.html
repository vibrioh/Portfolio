          After obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biomedicine from Tsinghua University, I became a Postdoctoral Fellow at
          Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/akarlab/meet-the-team/">Akar
            Lab</a>.
          I kept on learning new skills and built my own workstation for large scale gene sequencing analysis. With the
          help of my new skills I published many research papers on prestige journals and was invited as the editor and
          reviewer for the journals. As an alien of extraordinary ability, I was granted permanent residency via EB-1A.
          I knew I couldn't teach myself everything I wanted to learn, so I went back to Columbia University for the
          Master degreee in Computer Science. In 2018, I worked as a Research Scientist at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.graphen.ai/"
            target="_blank">Graphen,
            Inc</a> for 8 months then was promoted as the Principal Research Scientist of Big Data. Most of time I
          work as a DevOps engineer to design the RESTful layer, develop customer client, deploy and implement System
          automation. Sometimes I also work as a data scientist for feature selection, model building and evaluation. I
          have
          gained domain knowledge of finance, healthcare, cybersecurity in my current position.
