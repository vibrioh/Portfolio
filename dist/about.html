          After obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biology from Tsinghua University, I became a Postdoctoral Fellow at
          Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/akarlab/meet-the-team/">Akar
            Lab</a>.
          I kept on learning new skills and built my own workstation for large-scale gene sequencing analysis. With the
          help of my new skills, I published many research papers on prestige journals and was invited as the editor
          and
          reviewer for the journals. The <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vr8dYJsAAAAJ&hl=en">Google
            Scholar</a> records all my published papers. As an alien of extraordinary ability, I was granted permanent
          residency via EB-1A.
          I knew I couldn't teach myself everything I wanted to learn, so I went back to Columbia University for the
          Master degree in Computer Science. In 2018, I worked as a Software Engineer & Research Scientist at <a class="text-link"
            href="http://www.graphen.ai/" target="_blank">Graphen.
            Inc</a>. In the AI startup company, my work involves both product development and onsite project
          consulting. I have implemented the application module of the companyâ€™s graph database and contributed to
          the delivery of two AI solution projects at a total price of $11 million. I also collaborated with the
          Harvard research lab on a cancer classification study.
          I
          have
          gained domain knowledge of finance, healthcare, cybersecurity on my current position.
